- 👋 Hi, I’m @WattsDataScience
- 👀 I’m interested in predictive analytics and machine learning. I come from a background in Sport Science so also interested in ways to link Data Science with Sport. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Applied Data Science at Charles Sturt University in Sydney, Aus. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn, pretty much brain is a sponge.
